# Early triage of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 based on predicted prognosis: A Korean national cohort study


The jupyter notebook file named "triage_algorithm.ipynb" contains the codes with the coefficients for the ordinal logistic regression algorithms. The models were fitted onto the entire dataset of 5,596 COVID-19 patients. The codes are never intended to be used in practice. These are simply to show how the algorithm works and to present the coefficients. We made all our efforts to make sure there are no errors, but there still can be errors (or even worse, mistyped coefficients). If you spot any errors, please inform the authors.
